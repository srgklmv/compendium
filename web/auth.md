#### Identification, authentication, authorization

Identification answering the question "who you are?". I.e. looking for a
user with passed login.

Authentication is the process of proving that user is who they claim to be.
E.g. verify password of access token.

Authorization check out if user has access to resource. For example, getting 
user roles from jwt looking for admin role.
